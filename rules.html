    <h1>Rules for Password</h1>
    <p></p>
</body>Password security starts with creating a strong password.<br> A strong password is:

At least 12 characters long but 14 or more is better.<br>

A combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.<br>

Not a word that can be found in a dictionary or the name of a person, character, product, or organization.<br>

Significantly different from your previous passwords.<br>

Easy for you to remember but difficult for others to guess.<br> Consider using a memorable phrase like "6MonkeysRLooking^".
